# Hi there! 👋 I'm @oqhadev

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **passionate full-stack developer** with 10 years in the tech world. My journey started as a code enthusiast who turned passion into profession.

### 🌊 2025: Coding as a Hobby

In 2025, I'm embracing **coding as a hobby** - a beautiful, stress-free approach to development. After 10 years, now I remember again what I forgot - the fun feeling from my early years. It's about finding flow, enjoying the process, and creating with intention rather than pressure. Code should be elegant, the journey should be enjoyable! ✨

## 🎯 My Philosophy

> _"I master nothing, but I can do mostly all"_

I believe in being a **versatile generalist** with strong fundamentals. While I may not claim specialization in any single technology, my broad skill set and solid foundation allow me to tackle diverse challenges and adapt to new technologies quickly.

**My versatility spans:**

- **Scale:** From 5-line scripts to large-scale applications
- **Projects:** From small plugins to very useful applications
- **Platforms:** Mobile apps, desktop applications, and web solutions
- **Network:** From TCP handling to high-level web APIs
- **Architecture:** From monolithic applications to distributed systems
- **Deployment:** From local development to cloud infrastructure
- **Server Tools:** Backend systems that run on servers without users even noticing - the invisible infrastructure that keeps everything working seamlessly

Whether it's a simple automation script or a complex multi-platform system, I adapt to what the project needs.

## Professional Journey

- 🏢 **Industry Experience** - Led technical decisions and architecture
- 🔧 **Freelance Projects** - Diverse client solutions and challenges
- 🎨 **Personal Projects** - Continuous learning and experimentation

## 🌟 What Drives Me

- **Continuous Learning** - Technology evolves, and so do I
- **Problem Solving** - Love turning complex problems into elegant solutions
- **Versatility** - Jack of all trades, master of adaptation
